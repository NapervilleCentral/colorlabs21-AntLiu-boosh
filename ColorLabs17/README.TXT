Who- Critique
Try 1:
Nick: 4 color palate not enough detail

me: need to break up the big chunks, so adding more colors to narrow the ranges of each color would probably fix that

Try 2:
Nick: too narrow range of colors

me: blue is really boring, so an added red range to add contrast would probably work well, because it does work in the original Shepard Fairey 

Try 3:
Nick: makes background look odd

me: felt background oddness unavoidable with the two color system so just added final layer of color for darker colors and fixed lightest color to be tinted with blue, rather than being pure white.
