Who- Critique

Nick: 4 color pallete not enough detail
me: lots of big chunks, so added extra color in the middle

Nick: too narrow range of colors
added red range to add contrast

Nick: makes background look odd
felt background oddness unavoidable so just tried to add more layering for the big blobs that still exist (hair)
